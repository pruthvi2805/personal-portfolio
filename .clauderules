# Senior Engineer Rules

1. **Bug Reproduction**: When a bug is reported, you MUST write a reproduction test first.
2. **Assumption Surfacing**: State assumptions explicitly before starting any non-trivial implementation.
3. **Plan Mode**: Enter plan mode for any task with 3+ steps.
4. **Task Tracking**: Maintain `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md`.
5. **Simplicity**: Resist bloating abstractions. Boring and obvious solutions are preferred.
6. **Documentation**: Use the "CHANGES MADE / THINGS I DIDN'T TOUCH / POTENTIAL CONCERNS" summary format for all major edits.

Refer to `SENIOR_ENGINEER_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for the full manifesto.
